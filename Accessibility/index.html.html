<p>The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">W3C WAI Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility</a> I hope that you will find this report helpful and informative and find the recommendations to be actionable. </p>

<h2>Accessibility Checklist</h2>
<h3>Website Page Titles</h3>
<p>In the web page markup, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation, they help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser tab. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.</p>

<!-- green success css class -->
<p class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> 10 pages on the CCC website were evaluated for clear, unique HTML page titles. Each page has descriptive HTML title values. However, we do suggest that the title values have to be formatted as &quot;Page Title at CCC&quot;, for example, &quot;Groups at CCC&quot; so that it's obvious to users using the assistive technologies what website page they are on. </p>

<h3>Image Text Alternatives</h3>
<p>Image text alternatives ("alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.) Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. The alt attribute provides an alternative text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it. The reason can be a slow connection, an error with the image file, or if the user uses a screen reader.</p>
<!-- red thumbs down css class -->
<p class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i> No photos on the Staff, Classes, or Groups pages had descriptive alt text. This means that people using assistive technologies would not know what the photo or graphic is communicating. We recommend that all photos and graphics have descriptive alt text. </p>


<h3>Text:</h3>
 Headings, Contrast Ratio ("color contrast") and Resizing Text should not only support visual aesthetics but also support the navigation and visibility of text content.

<p class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Results - Headings<i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> 
We tested the Groups, Calendar and the Our Calling pages and headings tags are nested correctly. 
However, the CCC homepage has 3 H1 tags, there should only be one H1 per page because screen readers expect only one H1 tag. </p>


<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<p>Results - Contrast Ratio  <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> We tested the Groups, Calendar and Our Calling and there was strong color contrast because the pages are white and the heading titles are in black. The WAVE color contrast tester did flag the main navigation as a  color contrast issue because of the blue background and white text. Suggestion is to make the text a little larger or bold. </p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<p>Results - Resizing Text  <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i>The CCC website scales up text size using keyboard commands very well. Text was increased to 200% and readability remained comprehensible on a desktop and iPhone.</p>
</div>

 <h3>Interaction:</h3>
 <h4>Keyboard access and visual focus </h4>  
 <p>Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on a keyboard to interact with web pages. Keyboard focus should be clearly visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight. </p>
<!-- red success div -->
 <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<p>Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i> Using only keyboard keys to navigate the CCC website was very difficult. We could not open the sub-pages in the main navigation using our keyboard keys. There was no <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/accessibility_skip_links.php">Skip to Main</a> feature that allows keyword users to quickly skip to the main content section. Furthermore, Keyboard Focus was not obvious to us when we were using our tab and arrow keys. We recommend that the web team explore to make the CCC website more keyboard-only friendly.</p>
</div>


<h4>Forms, labels, and errors (including Search fields): </h4>
Users are able to keyboard navigate to the different forms fields. 
Each form control has a label element with a for attribute that matches the value of the id attribute in the related control. For example:
<ul>
    <li>Each form control has a <code>label</code> element with a <code>for</code> attribute that  matches the value of the <code>id</code> attribute in the related control. For example:<br>
        <code>&lt;label for="firstname"&gt;First name: &lt;/label&gt;<br>
        &lt;input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" /&gt;<br>
        </code> </li>
        <li>Each <code>id</code> is unique within the web page.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<p>Results <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i>
    We tested the Give page because it has a form. 
    Using only the keyboard, we were able to go to each form field and press submit. 
    However, the <a href="https://coloradocommunity.org/give">Give</a> page has a web form that does not have labels with a related unique ID.</p>
</div>


 <h3>General:</h3>
 <p>Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content: Moving, flashing, or blinking content includes carousels (example carousel), ads, videos, auto-updating stock tickers, scrolling news feeds, and more. 
    Users need to be able to control moving content, especially some people with attention deficit disorder or visual processing disorders.</p>
 
 <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
 <p>Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i><i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> The CCC has an image carousel on the homepage that does not allow the user to stop the moving of images. 
    The image gallery is not keyboard friendly. 
    None of the photos have alt text. We recommend that the current image carousel is replaced with an <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/">accessible image carousel</a>. No blinking or flashing content was located on the CCC website.</p>
</div>


 <p>Multimedia (video, audio) closed captions and transcripts</p>
 <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
 <p>Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i><i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> We tested to see if all CCC videos had closed captions and downloadable transcripts. The CCC homepage has a video without closed captions. The Calling page videos all had closed captions and the accuracy was high. We recommend that all CCC videos have closed captions and/or transcripts to allow people with hearing impairments to read or listen via assistive technologies. Closed caption remediation includes proper grammar, punctuation, and speaker name identification. </p>
</div>

 <p>Basic Structure Check: It helps you understand how some people "see" the web page differently. For this basic structure check, you look at the web page without images, styles, and layout.
Web pages are often designed with multiple columns, sections, colors, and other visual aspects that help organize information for people who see the page in its default display. 
However, some people do not see the page this way.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<p>Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i> For this test, we used WAVE to remove all CSS styles in order to see the CCC website without any visual styling. We tested the Classes page and noticed that this page is heavy on graphics without alt text and the "Alpha" class description comes up twice. Not sure why this is happening but this could be a problem for people using a screen reader. </p>
</div>
